* Is it possible that the large batch size is hurting us?  We could be getting stuck in local mins.
* We have updated the feeder to randomize, that may help.  
* This is definitely going a lot slower than the local machine.  Despite the fact that we process an image 4x faster the local machine with 10x fewer samples improves much faster. 
* Next run try reducing the batch size to the ballpark of 128 or 256.  Maybe the smaller batches are helping the local machine.
* Need to save and then test with no dropout.
